# Introduction

So here I am uploading all of my websites that I code. So every different folder inside this repo is a different project. They are not linked to each other.

## Requirements

You can create this website with notepad only lol. Using an IDE is a better choice :)

Also, link the bootstrap CDN links to your heading section.

## License
No licensing is required it is for educational purposes only. You can always modify the code as per your wish.
