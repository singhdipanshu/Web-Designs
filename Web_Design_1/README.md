# Introduction

This project is made by using  HTML, CSS and BootStrap. It is a complete beginner website and I have explained all the steps on my youtube channel. 

## Requirements

You can create this website with notepad only lol. Using an IDE is a better choice :)

Also, link the bootstrap CDN link to your head section.

## License
No licensing is required it is for educational purposes only. You can always modify the code as per your wish.
